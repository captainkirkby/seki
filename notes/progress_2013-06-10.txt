tl;dr as a first application, I've been setting Seki up as a CMS. For basic functionality it's now getting close to being usable.

I've had a little burst of activity on Seki in the past few weeks. A few blind alleys, but significant forward progress. Overall it's evolving. I'm now considering it an application framework and have a very long list of potential applications. They range from fairly generic things like e.g. helpdesk ticketing/issue management to more vertical things like a creative writing assistant. 
I need to break down this list pretty soon to help with deciding priorities, but some components are obviously common to many apps, providing top priorities. These components are:

System Admin
Content Management
User Management
Social Connectivity

At a system level, there's also the overarching need to support configuration and extensibility/plugability. I'll bundle these under System Admin. 

Plugability
