arq.qtest --earl manifest.ttl

Fuseki internal tests aren't DAWG/SPARQL-WG tests.  There aren't any proper protocol tests currently.  There are lots of query tests which are run by ARQ.

ARQ runs the WG test suite - there's a command line tool to run tests and if you point it at the "manifest-all.ttl" then it runs all the tests.  There are some entailment and federate query tests that don't pass out-of-the-box, and (dev system only - temporary) some property path tests may not work as the WG considers PP changes.  ARQ in dev has some proposed changes and these are different from the unmodified test suite.

There is also a test manifest parser that reads the manifest format and

It's not written to be extensible but taking a copy and hacking what you need might help.
