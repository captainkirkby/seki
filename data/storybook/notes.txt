Basic Features

    StorYBook has two views: the chronological view and the book view.
        The chronological view shows the scenes sorted by date.
        The book view in contrast shows the chapters and the assigned scenes as you would read it in the final book.
    Of course in both views the scenes and there related information can be edited any time.
    StorYBook helps you to keep the overview, especially for complex stories with two or more strands. Imagine StorYBook as some kind of a dynamic mind map.
    Strands and strand links: Each scene belongs to a primary strand. Optionally other related, secondary strands can be linked to a scene.
    Characters: Add, edit or remove characters and assign them to the related scenes.
    Locations: Add, edit or remove locations and assign them to the related scenes.
    Chapters: Define your chapters and assign the scenes.
    Parts: Large projects can be split into well arranged parts.
    Information: Scene related information of the currently selected part are shown as well as warnings for missing scenes or scenes existing twice. A overview list shows all present strands, characters and locations.
    Adjustable view: The chronological view can be resized any time to fit to screen, or to get a better overview if many strands are defined. Even more working space is available if you hide the information panel with a simple click on the tool bar.
    Instant save: Because StorYBook uses an embedded database called H2 to store data (and not a file) each input entered is saved in an instant. Even if the program crashes, you won't loose any data.
