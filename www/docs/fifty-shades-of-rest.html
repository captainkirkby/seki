<h1>Fifty Shades of REST</h1>

<p>I recently found myself working on a Web API and I need to explain my design
decisions so it seemed a good idea to try and pull together background notes as
well. Before going any further, I should make clear that the title here isn't
strictly accurate, the material here is about APIs that involve HTTP, with REST
only being one aspect of that.</p>

<h3>Changing a Representation</h3>

<p>It's very easy to lose sight of the relationship between resources and their
representations. This happened to me not long ago when I posted to a list
asking for clarification of the expectations for the PUT verb. The responses I
got were very helpful in bringing things back into focus. Although I had PUT in
mind, conceptually the situation is the same for any method that changes a
representation.</p>

<p>The scenario is that the server supports mutliple media types for each
resource. When a client does a PUT against a given resource, this will have a
specific media type, in other words it'll be a single representation of the
resource. The question is, how should this influence other representations of
the resource?</p>

<p>Say <code>http://example.org/basil</code> is my dog Basil [note
httpRange-14], and three representations are made available : one is a Web page
about him, another a photo, the third his vital statistics. These
representations are in formats <code>"text/html"</code>,
<code>"image/jpeg"</code> and <code>"text/turtle"</code> respectively. One of
the pieces of information about Basil is where he lives. So the relevant parts
of the representations might look something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong><strong> :</strong> <code>&lt;p&gt;Basil lives at
Mozzanella 7&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>JPEG : [photo]</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Turtle :</strong> <code>&lt;http://example.org/basil&gt;
:streetAddress "Mozzanella 7" .</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>But then Basil moves across the road to number 10. There are a few ways a
client might notify the server of this, in practice a POST from a HTML form
would be the most likely, a PATCH might also be appropriate if the server
supported this. But for the sake of argument, assume we've got a rich client
that does a PUT like so:</p>

<p><code>HTTP 1.1 PUT</code></p>

<p><code>&lt;http://example.org/basil&gt; :streetAddress "Mozzanella 10"
.</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>According to the HTTP spec, a PUT ...</p>

<p>But we want to continue providing both representations, and to keep them
up-to-date. So it would be reasonable to expect the new value to percolate
through the system (likely a backend database) and now provide a HTML
representation that looks like:</p>

<p></p>

<p><code>&lt;p&gt;Basil lives at Mozzanella 10&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>But what of the image of him? His physical appearance won't have changed, so
the same photo, the "image/jpeg" representation can be reused.</p>

<p>All that the system is contractually obliged to do is ensure the
representations of a resource are just that (and the bottom line is essentially
human judgement). Obviously a photo of my dog Sasha wouldn't be appropriate at
<code>http://example.org/basil</code>, but beyond things like that it really
has to be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
