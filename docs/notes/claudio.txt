modeling expressiveness (no information loss in the model);
ease of evolution (no upfront commitments in the model);

Virtual Repository is a framework for data collection tasks which leverages domain standards and a pluggable architecture of reusable, source-specific plugins to decouple sources and publication workflows

Staging Repository serves as the sole input source for the publication workflows to follow

workflows are executed by a Publication Engine and move the data from the Staging Repository to a Production Repository, in the form in which it can be exposed to clients

Publication Engine consults a third store, the Task Catalogue, to obtain instructions about how to publish the staged data, or else to process it as an update of previously published data

interactive front-end, the Management Console, allows administrative users to inspect stories, create tasks, and monitor the status of their execution
