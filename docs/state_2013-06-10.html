<p>Seki Web Application Framework : Summer Update</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> for a first concrete application, I've been building
<a href="https://github.com/danja/seki">Seki</a> up as a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">CMS</a>. For
basic functionality it's now getting close to being usable.</p>

<p><a href="#Call"><strong>Call for Funding</strong></a></p>

<p>So I've had a little burst of activity on Seki in the past few weeks. A few
blind alleys, but significant forward progress. Overall it's evolving, and the
ideas have been crystalizing a little, so I'll lay them out a bit here. I only
intended writing a brief update, but then... At some later date I'll probably
pull out the bits that aren't Seki-specific, there's quite a bit that I suppose
would come under the umbrella of Web app best practices.</p>

<p>I'm now considering Seki a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework">Web Application
Framework</a> with a long list of potential applications. They range from
fairly generic things like e.g. workflow/issue management or info aggregator to
more vertical things like a creative writing assistant or recording studio
equipment inventory system. As well as scratching a few of my own itches, I'd
like to use Seki as an experimental testbed, kicking the tyres of the relevant
technologies. There are plenty of WAFs around, several (like Seki) built on <a
href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. Seki's Unique Selling Proposition is
essentially it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web">Semantic
Web</a> foundation, though as far as I'm aware the <a
href="https://github.com/danja/seki#readme">full decoupling from the
datastore</a> is also unique. </p>

<p>I need to break down the potential applications list pretty soon to help
with deciding priorities, but some components are obviously common to many
apps, providing top priorities. A minimum viable product (in the sense of
something I can usefully make live) drops out of this - a simple CMS.</p>

<p>The components are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#System">System Admin</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Content">Content Management</a></li>
  <li><a href="#User">User Management</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Social">Social Connectivity</a></li>
</ul>

<p>At a system level, there's also the overarching need to support
configuration and extensibility/plugability. I'll bundle these under <a
href="#System">System Admin</a>. </p>

<h3><a name="Content" id="Content">Content Management</a></h3>

<p>I'll start with this because it's a well-known area. </p>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>A <a
href="http://www.amaxus.com/cms-blog/the-ultimate-web-cms-checklist-of-requirements">CMS
requirements checklist</a> can get very long. But the core functionality is
about creating, organizing and publishing documents. So the system needs
front-end tools for editing content, storage that allows structuring and
indexing (with associated user tools) and different ways of presenting the
documents. A fairly minimal system would support blogging: create/edit posts
(and comments), post discovery (categories, search, related resources etc.) and
at least views for single posts and a front page for recent posts. A blogging
engine suits me as a relatively short-term goal, I'm a big believer in eating
your own dogfood, and as soon as viable I'll start using Seki for my <a
href="http://dannyayers.com">own blog</a>. </p>

<p>Most CMSs are (unsurprisingly) highly focussed on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>. It is after all the primary
format on the Web. However, both <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>
(Seki's data model) are format-agnostic, and the conceptual model of RDF covers
any kind of data, not just documents. </p>

<p>Not unrelated, HTML isn't the only fruit. There are an awful lot more media
types out there. Any reasonable CMS will be able to deal appropriately with
things like images, audio and video files, but when we're talking about more
generalized hypermedia (with an emphasis on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdata">hyperdata</a>, Seki's core
domain) it's necessary to keep an eye on <a
href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">HATEOS</a>.
(though in a broader sense than <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding">Roy</a> frames it, with the H
standing for Hypermedia rather than just Hypertext). As <a
href="http://amundsen.com/blog/">Mike Amundsen</a> has <a
href="http://amundsen.com/hypermedia/">put it</a>: "<em>Hypermedia Types are
MIME media types that contain native hyper-linking semantics that induce
application flow. For example, HTML is a hypermedia type; XML is not.</em>"
(See also : <a
href="http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/05/exploring-hypermedia-with-mike-amundsen.html">Exploring
Hypermedia with Mike Amundsen</a>). In June 2013, after the Web's been around
for more than 20 years, it's remarkable that you can pretty much count the
media types that support links on one hand (including knuckles). The most
widespread ones are probably HTML, Atom, SVG, RDF (all formats) and one or two
proprietary systems like Flash and PDF. Even then, to qualify for Roy's HATEOS
the type also needs human/agent interface(s) that support the hyperlink <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordance</a>. That narrows the
list even more - e.g. the only RDF format that has standardized affordances is
RDFa (it sits on HTML).</p>

<p>And there's more. A common failing amongst current CMSs is their suboptimal
use of HTTP. For example, it's common to find a common endpoint that's used for
POSTing content and URLs of the form e.g.
<code>http://example.com/index.php?p=423</code>. These may be translated in use
by <code>mod_rewrite</code> or whatever to "<a
href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging#Pretty_Permalinks">Pretty
Permalinks</a>" like
<code>http://example.com/2003/05/23/my-cheese-sandwich</code>. Seki will
provide these pieces of functionality somewhat more natively: a resource will
be called e.g.   <code>http://example.com/2003/05/23/my-cheese-sandwich</code>
in the back-end store, it can be created/update/deleted using HTTP
(<code>GET</code>/<code>PUT</code>/<code>DELETE</code>) requests directly on
that URL. In other words, more <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>fully.
This is also in line with some of the core parts of the <a
href="https://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/wiki/Specification">Linked Data
API</a>. It's not a priority, but ultimately,for convenience, I'd like Seki to
support more of that, particularly referencing resources using <a
href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570">URI Templates</a>.</p>

<p><em>Incidentally, I just came across the OASIS <a
href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/cmis/CMIS/v1.1/cs01/CMIS-v1.1-cs01.html">Content
Management Interoperability Services spec</a>. It does use Atom/APP as a base
for one of it's bindings, but most of it is a big vocabulary of XML terms, and
I reckon chances are the Interoperability will 99% be limited to other systems
that speak CMIS. Haven't said it for a while, but I reckon it's called for here
: should've used RDF.</em></p>

<h4>Seki Design</h4>

<p>The aim is to reflect the requirements above in Seki, so it could be seen as
rather than Content Management System, a kind of Data Management System.
There's still a huge amount of <a
href="http://blackcalife.free.fr/datafiles/Informatique/Web/web_semantic/nodalities_issue2.pdf">Blue
Ocean</a> around the <a
href="http://readwrite.com/2009/04/18/web_of_data_machine_accessible_information">Web
of Data</a>, and one aim I have with Seki is to use it as an experimental
platform, exploring some new waters.</p>

<p>A key feature of Seki is that the backend database is a (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/">SPARQL 1.1</a> capable) <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>
triplestore. Like pretty much any other CMS, some way of mapping between the
document format and DB schema is needed. Templating of one form or another is
the usual approach, which ideally will be done in a way that helps keep
separate the view aspect from model and control. Using an RDF store offers huge
advantages over a traditional <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sql">SQL</a> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system">RDBMS</a>
for Web applications in terms of flexibility, in that schemas don't have to be
predefined. RDF triplestores also trump both SQL and most <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosql">NoSQL</a> DBs in terms of
Web-friendliness because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url">URL</a>
(more generally, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier">URI</a>/<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/#dfn-URI-reference">URIRef</a>/<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier">IRI</a>)
is treated as a first-class type, so everything can be intimately linked with
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>
protocol.</p>

<p>There are loads of alternatives for templating engine, and Seki uses <a
href="https://github.com/andyhot/freemarkerjs">freemarker.js</a>. Two main
factors led to this choice: I've used it before (the <a
href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/">original Java version</a>, within <a
href="http://stanbol.apache.org/">Apache Stanbol</a>) and it's <em>simple</em>
(essentially just content replacement and includes, simple conditional display
and lists). Many templating engines resemble full-blown programming languages
(cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a>), I'd suggest that
makes it too easy to overload the templating with extra functionality, breaking
the separation of concerns.</p>

<p>To allow consistency and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, the same
templating subsystem is used in Seki for formatting between the browser and
application and between the application and store (SPARQL queries/updates are
templated).</p>

<p>Regarding media types, having a triplestore backend means that the RDF
formats are a no-brainer. For Web presentation, HTML is essential. While
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> is the default media type for
HTML form POSTing, it doesn't really lend itself to reuse. A more versatile
choice here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>. However,
in itself, JSON doesn't have a notion of links. But <a
href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> does, with the bonus that it can also be
considered a fully-fledged RDF format. Things like images, audio and video can
all be handled in their own media types via REST. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)">Atom</a> (and <a
href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5023">Atom Protocol</a>) are desirable for
additional connectivity, see <a href="#Social">Social Connectivity</a> below.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> support would be nice
to have, to allow the use of other clients, but it's not really a priority.</p>

<p>So in the near term I want Seki to be able to handle (in both
directions):</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>JSON-LD</li>
  <li>Turtle </li>
  <li>Arbitrary media formats</li>
</ul>

<h4>Progress</h4>

<p><strong>Server-side</strong> : While HTML stays the main rendering format,
I've started augmenting this with a bit of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa">RDFa</a>. This is easy with the
templating system.</p>

<p>I've also been changing things to make JSON-LD the primary format for
passing info to the server. There's still quite a way to go with this, mostly a
matter of more general refactoring and code reorganization. I've got a libs at
hand that help with this, notably <a
href="https://github.com/Acubed/node-rdf">node-rdf</a> and <a
href="https://npmjs.org/package/jsonld">json-ld</a> (I held off incorporating
an RDF lib into Seki as long as I could as for most things it would be
overkill, but when it came to format conversion it seemed essential). </p>

<p>I've done a little coding towards 'baking' pages (turning them into static
files), the original motivation being performance, though it does seem a
generally a good idea, as <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404">Aaron
has described</a>. It's since occurred to me that this should be mighty handy
for archiving and versioning. Simply bake older versions together with relevant
metadata at a URI discoverable from the latest version of the page.</p>

<p><strong>Client-side</strong> : I've run through a few editing UIs - </p>
<ul>
  <li>simple form <code>textarea</code> - functional but ugly/limited</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.tinymce.com/">TinyMCE</a> - was pretty nice (and the
    <a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/RDFaCE.html">RDFaCE</a> RDFa +
    auto-annotation extension is very cool) but at the time I was running a
    separate HTTP server (in the Seki node.js code) on a different port to
    serve static files, and I ran into painful <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS</a> issues
    (I've since reverted to serving static files on the same port, but later
    want to offer an external static server as an option)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.aloha-editor.org/">Aloha</a> - has a neat UI, but
    it's surprisingly <strong>big</strong>, and when I tried customizing it
    (with CSS etc. and Backbone.js) it seemed more trouble that it was worth.
    Around this point I remembered Create.js - a bit of embarrasing memory loss
    as I did a keynote at a <a
    href="http://wiki.iks-project.eu/index.php/Workshops/Salzburg2012">workshop</a>
    in Salzburg featuring it last year).</li>
  <li><a href="http://createjs.org/">Create.js</a> (see <a
    href="http://createjs.org/demo/hallo/">demo</a>) - this is more or less a
    wrapper for an editor which makes it operate as a <a
    href="http://wiki.iks-project.eu/index.php/VIE">VIE</a> component. It
    supports other editors (including Aloha) but the default is <a
    href="http://hallojs.org/">Hallo</a>, my favourite editor to date.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wanted to use <a href="jquery.com">jQuery</a> and <a
href="jqueryui.com">jQueryUI</a> components in Seki's views, move to JSON-LD
for client -&gt; server messages and use <a
href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> to logically structure the
messages. This is pretty much how Create.js operates, plus RDFa to indicate
editable areas etc (a slight caveat is that it follows an earlier version of
the JSON-LD spec, but it only took a few lines of code to massage messages into
shape). </p>

<p>The general design approach of Create.js/VIE components is really good, they
support a good degree of system decoupling.</p>

<p>Right now I've got Create.js basically integrated, though it still needs a
fair bit of tweaking.</p>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<ul>
  <li>tweaking config of Create.js</li>
  <li>making views for blog front page, archive links etc.</li>
  <li>adding comment facility</li>
  <li>tests</li>
  <li>refactoring</li>
  <li>docs</li>
</ul>

<p>What I've not got around to yet are the finer points of HTTP, notably the
bits needed for caching (ETag &amp; Last-Modified). But basic support for these
is relatively straightforward.</p>

<h3><a name="User" id="User">User Management</a></h3>

<p>I recently covered the requirements and design of this part of Seki in <a
href="http://dannyayers.com/2013/05/28/User-Management-via-RDF">User Management
via RDF</a>. <em>[Oops, I just overwrote the image over there with the latest
version - oh well, it is the latest version...]</em></p>

<h4>Progress</h4>

<p>I've since tweaked the <a
href="https://github.com/danja/seki/blob/master/www/vocabs/usermanagement.ttl">vocab</a>
a little to improve modelling of <code>Space</code>s (sets of resources) and
added direct linkage to <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">FOAF</a>
profiles. </p>

<p><img alt="vocab structure"
src="http://dannyayers.com/stuff/seki/usermanagement-structure-smaller.png"
/></p>

<p>As it happens, the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form">jQueryUI
demo for a modal form dialogue</a> happens to be the Users part of a user
management UI, giving me a good starting point there. </p>

<p>I've put together a little bit of code to create a few default RDF graphs in
the triplestore on startup (with the <code><ins><ins>--init</ins></ins></code>
command-line option), including default instance data for <code>admin</code>
and <code>anonymous</code> users in a graph
(<code>http://hyperdata.org/users</code>).</p>

<p>Additional I've set up a basic user registration form. For this (and similar
forms) I plan to use the <a href="http://viejs.org/widgets/forms/">VIE form
generator component</a>. Unfortunately this currently only supports the JSON
model used by <a href="http://schema.rdfs.org/">schema.rdfs.org</a>. I've
started a little bit of utility code to transform RDF vocabs into this
format.</p>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<ul>
  <li>make admin UI to edit Users, Roles and Permissions</li>
  <li>make views for individual resources in the users graph (Users, Roles and
    Permissions)</li>
  <li>make <code>ASK</code> queries to check user's permissions for a given
    resource</li>
  <li>hook into auth chain, providing appropriate representation rendering</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Social" id="Social">Social Connectivity</a></h3>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>The general direction of this is towards the <a
href="http://dannyayers.com">blogosphere</a>, <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/danny.ayers">Facebook</a>, <a
href="https://plus.google.com/112609322932428633493/posts">Google+</a>, <a
href="https://twitter.com/danja">Twitter</a>, <a
href="https://delicious.com/danja">Delicious</a>, <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/danja">Flickr</a>, <a
href="http://pinterest.com/mozzanella/">Pinterest</a> etc. Hooking into the
blogosphere can in part be achieved by providing a syndication feed and a
built-in aggregator. Adding knowledge of <a
href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">FOAF</a> allows 'Friending'-like
functionality. And all this can fit in with a distributed Web environment.</p>

<p>I have no intention of implementing anything as complex as Facebook, and am
wary of walled gardens, but then again there's no reason to block such a thing
as a potential future application. Per-user spaces (like individual blogs, G+
pages or Twitter streams) and threaded discussions are certainly within scope.
</p>

<p>When it comes to things like Facebook's games and apps - it's a nice idea,
however cheesy they tend to be. See <a href="#Pluggabili1">pluggability</a>
below.</p>

<p>For linking into existing social net accounts, that can be achieved in some
cases via relatively straightforward APIs, otherwise more complex apps that
plug into the host system are potential options.</p>

<h4>Seki Design</h4>

<p>Blogosphere connectivity is fairly high up the priority list, mostly because
I want to use it myself. Atom feeds are the first thing, and a built-in
aggregator should be relatively straightforward later on (I've built several in
the past, having a triplestore backend is really handy). There is a bit of
trade-off judgement required with things like this. While snagging things like
one person's bookmarks from Delicious can be relatively lightweight, it won't
be desirable to mirror the whole of the blogosphere locally. I've not looked
with an eye to hooking into Seki yet, but there are plenty of summarising and
indexing/metadata-extracting tools out there, storing a little bunch of triples
for pages of interest would be good.</p>

<p>Spidering of FOAF (and similar material) is on the list, some care (maybe
limit to 1 hop) will be needed not to frighten the horses by appearing to
invade privacy.</p>

<p>For the fun of it I might well add a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP">Jabber</a> chat client/server. Might
even look into audio/video conferencing out of curiosity. Not really a priority
right now though.</p>

<h4>Progress</h4>

<p>All I've tried along these lines is grabbing &amp; converting a dump of my
Delicious bookmark data, putting that in the store to experiment against.</p>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Atom feed(s)</li>
  <li>FOAF profile builder (a la <a
    href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic">FOAF-a-matic</a>)</li>
  <li>feed aggregation</li>
  <li>FOAF/RDF spidering</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="System" id="System">System Admin</a></h3>

<p>Here I'll also include bits that didn't quite fit in the sections above.
Most is Seki-specific so I'll roll the following together :</p>

<h4>Requirements &amp; Seki Design</h4>

<div>
<p><strong>System configuration</strong> : Some of the config is dependent on
the host system and target SPARQL 1.1 store, those pieces must be configurable
externally. Within Seki there's the need to load config info on startup and
(ideally) allow its modification. At runtime there's a lot of potential for
configuration and even system extension using declarative definitions in the
RDF.</p>

<p><strong>Data management</strong> : In the most general case, RDF editing can
change any data. While crude, the query forms that are generally bundled with
SPARQL servers (like <a
href="http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/">Fuseki</a>, the one
used by default in Seki) offer this facility. A tool something like the (now
stale) <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/ajar/tab">Tabulator</a> generic data
browser/editor would be very nice to have. </p>

<p>It's hoped that VIE will help with application-specific data management. </p>
</div>

<p><strong id="Pluggabili"><a name="Pluggabili1"
id="Pluggabili1">Pluggability</a></strong> : to act as a framework, it must be
possible to plug in functional blocks or modules. Initially this will be
limited to CMS-like themes (packaged up custom templates, bootstrap data and
CSS etc). </p>

<p>Going further, a very powerful paradigm I'd like Seki to support in the near
future is in-place runtime code modification (and "hot code updates"), roughly
along the lines of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a> (e.g. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeak">Squeak</a>) or <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">emacs</a>, though using Javascript. I
think basic implementation will be relatively straightforward, but the
vulnerabilities this would potentially expose are likely to make the security
aspects (sandboxing) hard work. The plan is to disable the feature by default,
enabling it by a startup option to allow experimentation.</p>

<p>Drawing back a little, blocks of functionality could be implemented by
building them as (quasi-) self-contained services on HTTP, accessed via a
RESTful API. Hooks could be inserted into the code at appropriate points at
runtime to allow calling such services. I think it would be best to view such
services as little agents (I did some work around this a few years back, which
I presented at a Scripting for the Semantic Web meetup at ESWC2007 - must dig
out the slides). If the (HTTP) messages are suitably self-descriptive, it
should be straightforward to set up a simple <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming">Flow-Based
Programming</a> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a>, maybe
layered on <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async">async</a>. (See also: <a
href="http://noflojs.org/">NoFlo</a>). Of course, such services/agents could be
completely external to the system. </p>

<h4>Progress</h4>

<p>I've put together a bit of code to create default graphs and populate them
on startup (with the <code>--init</code> command-line option does
bootstrapping).</p>

<p>By default Seki will serve static files on the same port as dynamically
generated pages. It's now sing my own hacky server code. This only has minimal
features so far (compared to say <a
href="https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static">node-static</a>), though for a
bit of extra flexibility and to allow reuse I've implemented it as <a
href="http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/">Connect middleware</a>. My
justification for DIY is that I want to know what's going on internally, better
to provide hyperdata/hypermedia support.</p>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<ul>
  <li>integrate <a href="http://ace.ajax.org/">ACE source editor</a> (just for
    HTML &amp; Turtle for now)</li>
  <li>experiment with VIE components, in particular the form generator</li>
  <li>graph creation &amp; data file loading form</li>
  <li>set up <a href="http://stanbol.apache.org/">Stanbol</a> as an external
    service, dynamically hook Seki into it</li>
  <li>figure out theme packaging definition &amp; installation</li>
  <li>explore Tabulator-like tools, consider implementing something similar</li>
  <li>refactor the whole of Seki, setup up to allow <a
    href="https://npmjs.org/">npm</a> packaging</li>
  <li>tests &amp; docs</li>
  <li>live demo</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a bunch of other idea bits and pieces floating around, especially
using Seki to actually <strong>build custom applications</strong>. But I think
the above covers most of the priorities for a good while. They may well change
as I go along.</p>

<h4><a name="Call" id="Call">Call for Funding</a></h4>

<p>My recent burst of activity was done in time when I really should have been
doing work that would pay the bills. So if anyone has the ability to fund this
or knows of any approaches I could try to funding, please let me know. While
the dev path for Seki itself is pretty well determined for the near future, I
will happily be influenced by $$$. In particular, if you have an idea for a web
app that isn't already out there, fund me a bit (every little helps) and I'll
see what I can do about implementing it. The core Seki framework will always be
open source, but I wouldn't object to building closed source applications on
top.</p>

<p>If you're tempted by this but want to wait until you've seen a demo, let me
know and I'll ping you when I've got something live.</p>
